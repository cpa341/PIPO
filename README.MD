I modify the script to using for OFFLINE mode.

Test on PS4 Slim FW 10.50.

It can use with raspberry pi, linux system and armbian devices (tested on TV Box).
No need to install additional software.

Current goldhen support (FW) : 9.00, [10.00, 10.01], 11.00

Current hen support     (FW) : [8.00, 8.01, 8.03], [9.03, 9.04], [9.50, 9.51, 9.60], [10.50, 10.70, 10.71], 11.00

Current pppwn support   (FW) : 7.00 - 11.00

I provided some bin files for your test in folder /stage2/, replace new stage2_xx.xx.bin in /firmware/PPPwn/ to match your firmware.

When pwn don't touch anything will increase the success rate.
