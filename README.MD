I modify the script to using for OFFLINE mode.
Test on PS4 Slim FW 10.50.

It can use with raspberry pi, linux system and armbian devices (tested on TV Box).
No need to install additional software.

Current goldhen support (FW) : 9.00, [10.00, 10.01], 11.00
Current hen support        (FW) : [10.50, 10.70, 10.71]
Current pppwn support   (FW) : 9.00 - 11.00 (Below FW also support).

When goldhen release for new firmware, replace new stage2_xx.xx.bin in /firmware/PPPwn/.
